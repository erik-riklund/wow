--[[~ Utility: Inherit Parent ~

  Version: 1.0.0 | Updated: 2024/09/30

  This utility allows a child table to inherit properties and methods from a parent table by setting
  the parent table as the `__index` in the child's metatable. This creates an inheritance-like relationship
  where the child gains access to the parentâ€™s methods and properties.
