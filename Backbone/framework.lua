  Author(s): Erik Riklund
  Version: 1.0.0 | Updated: 2024/09/23

  This module handles the creation and management of plugins. Plugins are registered 
  with a unique identifier to prevent conflicts, and once registered, their state 
  becomes immutable. Immutability guarantees the integrity of each plugin, preventing 
  any unintentional changes that could lead to unpredictable behavior.

--[[~ Module: Task Management ~

  Author(s): Erik Riklund
  Version: 1.0.0 | Updated: 2024/09/23

  This module handles task execution, both synchronous and asynchronous. Tasks are

  single task hogs too much processing time. Asynchronous tasks are queued to be 
  executed when the system allows, avoiding performance bottlenecks.
