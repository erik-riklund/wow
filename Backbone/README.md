## 1. Introduction

Backbone is built to streamline the process of addon development by offering:

- A clean, intuitive and performant structure.
- Utilities for common tasks such as event handling, configuration, and data storage.
- Compatibility with the latest versions of World of Warcraft.

Whether you're creating your first addon or enhancing an existing one, Backbone helps you focus on functionality instead of boilerplate code.

*Extend and enhance the introduction to make it interesting!*

### Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead to ensure your addon remains performant.
- **Performance**: The framework is designed with performance in mind, enabling and encouraging developers to create addons that load dynamically when needed, optimizing gameplay by minimizing initial loading times.
- **Inter-addon cooperation**: Designed to promote seamless interaction between addons, enabling developers to build collaborative and interconnected features.
- **Event handling**: Simplified registration and handling of WoW API events to streamline event-driven programming.
- **State management**: Built-in support for managing and persisting addon data (saved variables).
- **Configuration handling**: Offers robust tools for managing addon configuration, along with a simplified API for seamlessly integrating settings into the standard WoW interface.
- **Localization support**: Provides efficient handling of localized strings, making it easy to create addons that support multiple languages and regions.

The framework not only emphasizes performance but also fosters a cooperative ecosystem where addons can communicate and integrate efficiently. Developers can leverage shared data through services and channels, enabling richer experiences for players while maintaining compatibility.

### Getting started

*Provide information about extensions to enable full typing during development.*

---
### Usage examples

Each example use the variable `plugin` to represent an active plugin.

```lua
--The name of the plugin must match the name of your addon folder.
local plugin = backbone.createPlugin 'MyAddon'
```

---
#### Hello world
As per programming standards, here is a basic "Hello world" example.

```lua
plugin:onReady(function () print 'Hello world' end)
```

---
#### Event listeners
This example demonstrates how to register an event listener using the [`registerEventListener`](#pluginregistereventlistenerevent-string-listener-listener) method. The `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` event triggers a welcome message that includes the player's name.

```lua
plugin:registerEventListener(
  'PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD', {
    --The function that is executed when the event occur.
    callback = function() print ('Welcome '.. UnitName ('player')) end

    --The identifier is used for error reporting and removing listeners.
    identifier = 'PlayerGreeting', -- (optional)

    --If explicitly set to `false`, the listener is removed after being invoked.
    persistent = false -- (optional, default = true)
  }
)
```

---
#### Using network channels
*Add a description of what the example demonstrates.*

```lua
--The second parameter (options) is optional. This example simply
--demonstrates the default values for the channel options.

plugin:createChannel ('A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL', { async = true, internal = false })
```

*Add a description of what the example demonstrates.*

```lua
local firstArg = true
local secondArg = 'Eh?'

plugin:invokeChannelListeners ('A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL', firstArg, secondArg)
```

*Add a description of what the example demonstrates.*

```lua
plugin:registerChannelListener (
  'A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL', {
    callback = function() --[[ do something... ]] end
    identifier = 'ChannelExample', -- (optional)
    persistent = false -- (optional, default = true)
  }
)
```

## 3. Plugin API reference

#### `plugin:getId() -> id: string`
Retrieves the unique identifier of the plugin.

---
#### `plugin:getName() -> name: string`
Retrieves the display name of the plugin.

---
#### `plugin:onReady(callback: function)`

Registers a function to be executed when the plugin is fully initialized. This method is ideal for centralizing and organizing addon startup logic, ensuring that your code runs at the correct time during the game's loading process. Can be used any number of times; the registered functions are executed in the order they were added.

- `callback`: A function that will be invoked when the plugin is loaded. The function can be used to set up initial states, register event listeners, or perform other setup tasks. The callback does not take any arguments by default but can leverage closures or external variables for context.

---
#### `plugin:registerEventListener(event: string, listener: Listener)`
Registers a listener for a specified game event.
- `event`: The name of the event to listen for (e.g., `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`, `CHAT_MSG_SAY`). This is case-sensitive and must match the game's standard event names.
- `listener`: A table defining the behavior of the listener. See [`Listener`](#listener) for details on its structure and options.

---
#### `plugin:removeEventListener(event: string, identifier: string)`
Removes a previously registered event listener for a specified event.
- `event`: The name of the event associated with the listener you want to remove.
- `identifier`: The unique identifier assigned to the listener when it was registered. This is required to precisely target and remove the specific listener.
