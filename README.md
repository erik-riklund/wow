## 1. Introduction

Backbone is built to streamline the process of addon development by offering:

- An easy-to-use and performant structure.
- Utilities for common tasks such as event handling, configuration, and data storage.
- Compatibility with the latest versions of World of Warcraft.

Whether you're creating your first addon or enhancing an existing one, Backbone helps you focus on functionality instead of boilerplate code.

*Extend and enhance the introduction to make it interesting!*

### Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead to ensure addons remain performant.
- **Performance**: The framework is designed with performance in mind, enabling and encouraging developers to create addons that load dynamically when needed, optimizing gameplay by minimizing initial loading times.
- **Inter-addon cooperation**: Designed to promote seamless interaction between addons, enabling developers to build collaborative and interconnected features.
- **Event handling**: Simplified registration and handling of WoW API events to streamline event-driven programming.
- **State management**: Built-in support for managing and persisting addon data (saved variables).
- **Configuration handling**: Offers robust tools for managing addon configuration, along with a simplified API for seamlessly integrating settings into the standard configuration interface.
- **Localization support**: Provides efficient handling of localized strings, making it easy to create addons that support multiple languages and regions.

The framework not only emphasizes performance but also fosters a cooperative ecosystem where addons can communicate and integrate efficiently. Developers can leverage shared data through services and channels, enabling richer experiences for players while maintaining compatibility.

### Getting started

*Provide information about extensions to enable full typing during development.*

### Usage examples

Each example use the variable `plugin` to represent an active plugin, which is an instance of the `Plugin` class. The `Plugin` class is the central class that represents a plugin in the Backbone framework. It contains methods for registering event listeners, creating channels, and more. The examples will demonstrate how to use the different methods and features of the `Plugin` class.

```lua
--The name of the plugin must match the name of your addon folder.
local plugin = backbone.createPlugin 'MyAddon'
```

As per programming conventions, here is a basic 'Hello World' example. While the example itself is simple and straightforward, the [`onReady`](#pluginonreadycallback-function) method plays a critical role. This method is essential for initializing your addon, as it ensures that all registered callbacks are executed only after everything is fully loaded, including saved variables.

```lua
plugin:onReady(function () print 'Hello world' end)
```

---
#### Event listeners
The following example demonstrates how to register an event listener for the `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` event. When the event occurs, the specified callback function is executed, displaying a personalized welcome message using the player's name. An optional identifier, *PlayerGreeting*, is assigned to the listener, allowing for easy debugging or removal if necessary. Additionally, the listener is configured to be non-persistent by setting the `persistent` option to `false`, meaning it will automatically be removed after being triggered once. By default, listeners are persistent unless explicitly set otherwise.

```lua
plugin:registerEventListener(
  'PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD', {
    callback = function() print ('Welcome '.. UnitName ('player')) end
    identifier = 'PlayerGreeting', -- (optional)
    persistent = false -- (optional, default = true)
  }
)
```

---
#### Using network channels
Network channels enable plugins to establish and manage communication pathways for transmitting messages or data, either within an addon (if internal) or between addons. By default, channels are not limited to internal use, and their listeners operate asynchronously.

```lua
plugin:createChannel ('A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL', { async = true, internal = false })
```

The following example demonstrates invoking all listeners on the channel `A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL` and passing the variables `first` and `second` as arguments. Each registered listener will receive these arguments when its callback is executed. If the channel is designed to communicate with other addons, it is essential to provide clear documentation for the arguments being passed.

```lua
local first = true
local second = 52

plugin:invokeChannelListeners ('A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL', first, second)
```

The example below demonstrates how to register a listener for the channel `A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL`. An optional identifier, *ChannelExample*, is assigned to the listener, allowing for easier debugging or removal. Additionally, the listener is set to be non-persistent, meaning it will be automatically removed after being triggered once. By default, listeners are persistent, but this can be adjusted by explicitly setting the `persistent` option to `false`.

```lua
plugin:registerChannelListener (
  'A_CUSTOM_CHANNEL', {
    callback = function() --[[ do something... ]] end
    identifier = 'ChannelExample', -- (optional)
    persistent = false -- (optional, default = true)
  }
)
```

---
#### Saved variables

The example below demonstrates retrieving and modifying saved variables. It is important to use the `onReady` method to ensure that the saved variables are loaded before accessing them.

```lua
plugin:onReady(
  function ()
    local accountValue = plugin:getAccountVariable 'VARIABLE_NAME'
    local characterValue = plugin:getCharacterVariable 'OTHER_VARIABLE'

    -- Perform operations using the retrieved values...

    plugin:setAccountVariable ('VARIABLE_NAME', 42)
  end
)
```

---
#### Managing settings

?

## 2. Framework reference

### Static resources

#### `backbone.activeLocale`
The active locale of the game client, represented as a string (`enUS`, `deDE`, etc.).

#### `backbone.currentExpansion`
The current expansion level of the game, represented as a number (see [`EXPANSION_LEVEL`](#enumexpansion_level)).

---
### Methods

#### `backbone.createPlugin(name: string) -> plugin: Plugin`
Creates a new plugin with the specified name. Throws an error if a plugin with that name already exists.
- `name` The desired name of the plugin. *Must match the folder name of your addon.*

#### `backbone.hasPlugin(name: string) -> hasPlugin: boolean`
Checks if a plugin with the specified name exists.
- `name` The name of the addon.

#### `backbone.onAddonLoaded(addon: string, callback: function)`
Registers a callback to be executed when the specified addon has fully loaded. For a pluginâ€™s own loading event, the [`onReady`](#pluginonreadycallback-function) method should be used instead to guarantee that the plugin is fully initialized before the callback is invoked.
- `addon` The name of the addon.
- `callback` The function to be executed.

---
#### `backbone.executeTask(task: Task)`
Executes a task synchronously, blocking execution until the task is completed. This method is suitable for scenarios where immediate execution and completion of the task are required before proceeding to the next step.
- `task` The task object (see [`Task`](#task)).

#### `backbone.executeTaskAsync(task: Task)`
Executes a task asynchronously, allowing other operations to continue while the task is being processed. This method is ideal for tasks that may take time to complete or for maintaining smooth gameplay performance without blocking other operations.
- `task` The task object (see [`Task`](#task)).

---
#### `backbone.getItemId(link: string) -> itemId: string`
Extracts the item ID from an item link.
- `link` The item link.

#### `backbone.getItemInfo(item: number|string) -> itemInfo: ItemData`
Retrieves detailed information about an item specified by its ID or link. Combines basic and detailed item data into a structured format (see [`ItemData`](#itemdata)).
- `item` An item ID or link.

#### `backbone.getItemLevel(info: number|string) -> actualItemLevel: number`
Retrieves the actual item level of the specified item.
- `info` The item link or ID for which to retrieve the item level.

#### `backbone.getLootslotInfo(slot: number) -> slotInfo: LootslotInfo`
Retrieves detailed information about a specific loot slot. Combines data from multiple APIs into a structured format (see [`LootslotInfo`](#lootslotinfo)).
- `slot` The index of the loot slot (1-based).

---
#### `backbone.throw(exception: string, ...: string)`
Throws a formatted exception with the specified message, formatting it if additional arguments are provided, and raises an error with a stack trace at level 3 for better debugging.
- `exception` The exception message to throw. Supports formatting placeholders.
- `...` Additional arguments to format the exception message. *`optional`*

---
### Classes

Each class listed below features a constructor, which is a globally accessible function named after the class. If a constructor is not explicitly documented, it is parameterless. For classes that support object creation without arguments, the shorthand syntax `new 'ClassName'` provides a convenient alternative.

---
#### Dictionary

The `Dictionary` class provides a flexible and efficient way to manage key-value pairs. It offers methods to add, retrieve, update, and remove entries, as well as iterate through all key-value pairs. This class is useful for managing dynamic collections of data where keys need to be associated with specific values in a structured manner.

##### `Dictionary(initialContent?: table) -> Dictionary`
Creates a new `Dictionary` instance with optional initial content.
- `initialContent?` A table containing key-value pairs to initialize the dictionary.
  - If omitted, the dictionary starts empty.

##### `Dictionary:getIterator() -> iterator: function, content: table`
Returns an iterator function and the dictionary's content table for looping through key-value pairs.

##### `Dictionary:hasEntry(key: string|table) -> entryExists: boolean`
Checks whether the dictionary contains an entry with the specified key.

##### `Dictionary:forEach(callback: function)`
Applies a callback function to each key-value pair in the dictionary.
- `callback` A function that is invoked for each key-value pair in the dictionary, receiving the key and its associated value as arguments.
  - If the callback returns a non-nil value, the key is updated with the returned value.

---
#### Listenable

The `Listenable` class provides a foundational system for registering, managing, and invoking listeners. It is designed to handle event-driven behavior efficiently, allowing developers to attach custom logic to specific triggers or events.

##### `Listenable:getListenerCount() -> count: number`
Returns the number of listeners currently registered with the object.

##### `Listenable:registerListener(listener: Listener)`
Registers a new listener to the current object.

- `searchValue` The value to search for in the vector.

##### `Vector:joinElements(separator: string, from?: number, to?: number) -> joinedElements: string`
Joins elements of the vector into a string, separated by the specified separator.
- `separator` The string to use as a delimiter between elements.
- `from?` The starting index of the range to join. Defaults to 1.
- `to?` The ending index of the range to join. Defaults to the vector's size.

##### `Vector:unpackElements() -> ...unknown`
Unpacks and returns all elements of the vector as multiple return values.

Retrieves the display name of the plugin.

---
### Event handling

*Add a description of this section.*

#### `plugin:onReady(callback: function)`
Registers a function to be executed when the plugin is fully initialized. This method is ideal for centralizing and organizing addon startup logic, ensuring that your code runs at the correct time during the game's loading process. Can be used any number of times; the registered functions are executed in the order they were added.
- `callback`: A function that will be invoked when the plugin is fully loaded, saved variables included. The callback does not take any arguments by default, but can leverage closures or external variables for context.

#### `plugin:registerEventListener(event: string, listener: Listener)`
Registers a listener for a specified game event.
- `event`: The name of the event to listen for. This is case-sensitive and must match the game's standard event names.

---
### State management

The state management methods provides a convenient way to store and retrieve data associated with the plugin, such as settings or cached values. These methods are designed to be simple and easy to use, while also providing a robust and reliable way to manage state across different game sessions.

> **Important**: The state management methods should be wrapped inside an [`onReady`](#pluginonreadycallback-function) call to ensure that the variables have been loaded. If the methods are called before the variables have been loaded, they will not be available.

#### `plugin:getAccountVariable(key: string) -> value: unknown`
Retrieves a value from the plugin's account-wide saved variables, or `nil` if the key does not exist.
- `key` The key of the variable to retrieve.

#### `plugin:setAccountVariable(key: string, value: unknown)`
Sets a value in the plugin's account-wide saved variables.
- `key` The key of the variable to set.
- `value` The value to be stored.

#### `plugin:getCharacterVariable(key: string) -> value: unknown`
Retrieves a value from the plugin's character-specific saved variables, or `nil` if the key does not exist.
- `key` The key of the variable to retrieve.

#### `plugin:setCharacterVariable(key: string, value: unknown)`
Sets a value in the plugin's character-specific saved variables.
- `key` The key of the variable to set.
